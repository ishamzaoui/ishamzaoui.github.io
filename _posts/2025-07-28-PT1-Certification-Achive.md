## Overview  
I'm thrilled to announce that I‚Äôve earned the **PT1 (TryHackMe Junior Penetration Tester Level 1)** certification! üéâ  
I scored **813/1000** on my **first attempt**, and completed the exam‚Äîincluding the **full report writeup**‚Äîin just **10‚ÄØhours and 46‚ÄØminutes**, well under the 48‚Äëhour permitted window.

## What the Exam Entails  
The PT1 certification is a **fully hands-on**, **industry-designed**, **48-hour** practical assessment across three domains:  
- **Web Application Testing (40%)**  
- **Network Penetration Testing (36%)**  
- **Active Directory Exploitation (24%)** 

Importantly, the exam requires you to submit a **written HTML‚Äëstyle report** via the exam platform, with clear documentation, CVSS scoring, remediation recommendations, and business context‚Äîgraded automatically using AI tools

## Why PT1?  
This certification stood out for simulating a real-world penetration testing engagement from start to finish‚Äîdiscovering vulnerabilities, exploiting systems, moving laterally across the environment, and crafting a professional report. It covers every critical phase of a pentest, from enumeration to post-exploitation and documentation,

## Key Skills Demonstrated  
- **Reconnaissance & Enumeration**  
- **Web App Exploitation** (e.g. SQLi, XSS, SSRF, authentication bypass)  
- **Network Pentesting** and lateral movement (SMB, FTP, RDP, brute-forcing, pivoting)  
- **Active Directory Attacks** (Kerberoasting, AS‚ÄëREP roasting, Pass‚Äëthe‚ÄëHash/Ticket, LDAP abuse)  
- **Privilege Escalation** on Linux/Windows targets  
- **Professional Reporting**: clear write-up with CVSS scoring, risk prioritization, and actionable remediation.

## Challenges & Highlights  
The real challenge was time management‚Äîbalancing thorough testing in all three domains and structuring a comprehensive report under a 48-hour deadline. Completing everything in less than half the timeframe was demanding but highly rewarding. The AI‚Äëgraded write-up system also pushed me to be precise and clear in documentation.

## Conclusion  
The **TryHackMe PT1 certification** offers an authentic and demanding hands-on pentest experience‚Äîfrom external web app testing to internal AD exploitation and professional reporting. If you want a certification that reflects real-world pentesting‚Äîfrom exploitation to executive-level documentation‚Äîthis is an excellent one to pursue.

Scored well. Finished quickly. Learned tons. On to the next challenge! üíªüîê
