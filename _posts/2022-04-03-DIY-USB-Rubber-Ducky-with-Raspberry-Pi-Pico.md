## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a **USB Rubber Ducky** using a **Raspberry Pi Pico** as a keyboard HID (Human Interface Device). The device can execute custom scripts for penetration testing, automating tasks, and ethical hacking. It supports **French (FR) and US keyboard layouts**, along with a custom scripting syntax.

### Features:
- **Raspberry Pi Pico as a USB HID Keyboard**
- **Custom scripting engine** for executing payloads
- **Support for multiple keyboard layouts (FR, US)**
- **Python-based execution engine**
- **Adafruit HID library support**

## Hardware Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**
- **USB cable**
- **Computer for writing and running scripts**

## Software Implementation
### 1. Setting Up the Raspberry Pi Pico
1. Download and install **MicroPython** firmware on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
2. Use **Thonny IDE** or another Python editor to upload scripts.
3. Install **Adafruit HID library** to handle keyboard emulation.

### 2. Writing Payloads
The scripting syntax allows you to define keystrokes, delays, and commands, similar to traditional USB Rubber Ducky payloads. Example syntax:

```text
WAIT 1000
WRITE Hello, World!
ENTER
```

### 3. Executing the Script
1. Write the payload script.
2. Upload it to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
3. Plug the device into a target machine, and it will execute the keystrokes automatically.
