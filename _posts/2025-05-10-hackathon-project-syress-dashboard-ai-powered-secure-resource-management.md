## Overview
During the **0x4FUN Hackathon (May 2025)**, our team developed **SYRESS Dashboard**, an AI-powered platform for secure enterprise resource management. The project integrates **AI/ML models, blockchain storage, and hybrid cloud deployment** to ensure data integrity, automation, and GDPR compliance. Below are the key components and outcomes.

### Key Layers
1. **User Interaction**  
   - **Okta SSO** for secure access (RBAC + MFA).  
   - System Admins interact via a React-based dashboard.

2. **Application Layer**  
   - **React Frontend**: Responsive UI for resource management.  
   - **FastAPI Backend**: Orchestrates data flow and API requests.

3. **AI/ML Layer**  
   - **RAG Engine**: Handles forecasting, classification, and reporting.  
   - **CV Model**: OCR for document structuring.

4. **Data & Security Layer**  
   - **Hyperledger Fabric**: Blockchain storage for immutable records.  
   - **AWS KMS + AES-256/TLS 1.3**: Encryption for data at rest/transit.

5. **Deployment Layer**  
   - **Hybrid Cloud**: AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3) + OpenStack (private cloud).

---

## Use Case Scenario
A multinational corporation uses SYRESS to:  
1. Upload financial documents via the React UI.  
2. Automate OCR and classification via the CV Model.  
3. Generate forecasts using the RAG Engine.  
4. Store hashes in Hyperledger Fabric with AWS KMS encryption.  
5. Ensure GDPR compliance via Okta RBAC and audit logs.

## Advantages
- **Security**: Blockchain + Okta + AES-256/TLS 1.3.  
- **Automation**: AI-driven insights (RAG + CV).  
- **Scalability**: Hybrid cloud (AWS + OpenStack).  
- **Compliance**: GDPR-ready design.
