## Overview
I'm excited to announce that I have earned the **eJPTv2 (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)** certification from **INE**! 🎉 This certification is a great milestone in my cybersecurity journey, focusing on penetration testing skills and knowledge.

The eJPTv2 is recognized as a beginner-level certification for penetration testers, covering a wide range of topics including network attacks, web application security, and vulnerability assessments.

## Why eJPTv2?
The eJPTv2 certification allowed me to demonstrate my skills in various penetration testing tools, methodologies, and best practices. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to pursue a career in cybersecurity, especially for those who are interested in hands-on, practical knowledge.

## Key Takeaways
Here are a few key areas I gained experience in during the certification process:
- **Penetration Testing Basics**: Understanding the phases of a penetration test and applying them to real-world scenarios.
- **Networking & Scanning**: Using tools like Nmap and Netcat to scan and enumerate networks.
- **Web Application Security**: Identifying vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) in web apps.
- **Exploitation Techniques**: Gaining practical experience with Metasploit and other exploitation tools.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Learning techniques to maintain persistence and escalate privileges.

## Tools & Resources
Here are some of the tools I used during my eJPTv2 preparation:

- **Kali Linux**: A go-to OS for penetration testing and ethical hacking.
- **Metasploit**: A powerful tool for exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Burp Suite**: Essential for web application security testing.
- **Nmap & Netcat**: Great for network scanning and exploitation.
- **John the Ripper**: A fast password cracking tool for breaking hashes and performing brute-force attacks.
- **Hashcat**: Another powerful password cracking tool, known for its GPU acceleration and support for a wide range of hash types.
- **WPScan**: A specialized tool for identifying vulnerabilities in WordPress websites.
- **Dirb**: A URL and directory brute-forcing tool, helpful for discovering hidden resources on web servers.
- **Hydra**: A fast network login cracker, supporting numerous protocols for brute-force attacks.

## Challenges Faced
One of the biggest challenges during the exam was time management. There were many tasks to complete in a limited amount of time, so prioritizing tasks and staying calm under pressure was key. But it was a great learning experience!

## Conclusion
The eJPTv2 has been an incredibly rewarding certification to earn, and it has strengthened my foundation in penetration testing. I'm looking forward to applying these skills in real-world situations and continuing my cybersecurity journey.

If you're looking to get into penetration testing, I highly recommend pursuing the eJPTv2 as your first step!
