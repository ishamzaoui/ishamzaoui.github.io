## Overview  
I'm proud to share that I have successfully earned the **eCPPTv3 (eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester)** certification from **INE**! ðŸŽ‰ This achievement represents a major milestone in my journey toward becoming a well-rounded cybersecurity professional.

The eCPPTv3 is a highly respected certification that validates advanced knowledge and hands-on skills in various areas of penetration testing, including network, web, Active Directory, and system exploitation. Iâ€™m especially proud to mention that I passed the practical exam in **just 10 hours**, far below the allowed timeâ€”showcasing both speed and skill.

## Why eCPPTv3?  
I chose the eCPPTv3 because of its heavy emphasis on **real-world, hands-on penetration testing**. Unlike theory-based exams, this one places you in a live lab environment where you must demonstrate technical ability, critical thinking, and exploitation techniques across multiple layers of a network.

## Key Takeaways  
Here are the main areas I gained experience in during the certification process:  
- **Network Penetration Testing**: Scanning, enumeration, and exploiting network services.  
- **Web Application Exploitation**: Attacking modern web vulnerabilities such as SQLi, XSS, file inclusion, and more.  
- **System & OS Exploitation**: Gaining access to Linux and Windows targets using various vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  
- **Privilege Escalation**: Elevating access on compromised systems using local exploits, misconfigurations, and credential reuse.  
- **Active Directory Attacks**: Performing attacks like Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, and enumeration of AD environments.  
- **Lateral Movement**: Moving between machines using harvested credentials and pivot techniques to compromise additional systems.  
- **Pivoting & Internal Access**: Establishing footholds and navigating internal environments post-compromise.

## Challenges Faced  
The exam lab environment was demanding and realisticâ€”just like a real engagement. Thereâ€™s no multiple-choice here: everything is hands-on. You must exploit targets, pivot through the network, escalate privileges, and demonstrate full compromise. Passing it in **10 hours** was tough but incredibly satisfying.

## Conclusion  
The **eCPPTv3** is one of the most practical and complete penetration testing certifications available. It sharpened my red team skills and gave me deep confidence in handling real-world assessmentsâ€”from external access to internal Active Directory environments.

If you're looking for a cert that challenges your hands-on skills across multiple domains of offensive security, **eCPPTv3** is the way to go.

Keep learning. Keep hacking (ethically)! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
