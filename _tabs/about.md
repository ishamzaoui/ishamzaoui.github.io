# WHOAMI!

# I’m Hamzaoui Mohamed

A dedicated and results-driven **Technology Student** at **TEK-UP University** with a strong foundation in **cybersecurity**, **software development**, and **embedded systems**. My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience in secure coding practices, vulnerability assessment, and implementing defensive/offensive security measures to safeguard systems and data.  

I am deeply passionate about cybersecurity, with demonstrated expertise in competitive **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenges, where I’ve honed my problem-solving skills and technical proficiency in real-world scenarios. My interests span **penetration testing**, **security analysis**, and **digital forensics**, and I thrive on tackling challenges in domains like **OSINT**, **cryptography**, and **web security**.  

Beyond cybersecurity, I am skilled in **software development** and **hardware-related projects**, with hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying scalable applications and hardware solutions. As an active **Technical Team Member** at the **TEK-UP Security Club**, I contribute to innovative projects and foster a culture of security awareness within the community. In my role, I specialize in the **hardware category**, where I create and design hardware-related tasks and challenges, further expanding my expertise in embedded systems and hardware security.
